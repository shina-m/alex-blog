Repent today from my pride and vanity. Concerning pride, May I humble myself to see my need. Let me focus and fix my eyes on Jesus, who will save me from sin; in doing that, I'm way far from fault finding others or looking down on them. Yes, I may acknowledge or discern their sin or ignorance, yet I may show mercy just as the Father has given me mercy. What do I have which was not given to me? And why do I act like something when I'm nothing? (1 Corinthians 4;7, Galatians 6:3) (I have the exact Adamic nature that was bought out from the filth of sin). Father, cleanse this pride and self that I see in me.

Vanity and the world's golden store are so embedded in me. I take the excuse to gather in vanity for my family's sake and 'financial security', but it draws me away from my first love. Cleanse me, Dear Lord, on this day. I pray that you will save me from this wretchedness Dear Lord. And that I will see Christ's reproach far better than riches. I am so hopeful my Father will do so.

I want to love you with all my heart and only see money as a thing or servant ( just like tissue paper)

And make me see people like you see them. (A love to save from sin and love to heal from the consequences of sin).
